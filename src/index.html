          <h4>Tooling Up</h4>
          <p>Written on <i>Wed Mar 16 2016</i></p>
          <p class="--bump-text-size">
            Got the alpha version of gulp4 today. Was it necessary? Probably
            not, but I certainly am happy to see the
            <a target="_blank" href="http://fettblog.eu/gulp-4-parallel-and-series/">
              <code>gulp.series()</code> and <code>gulp.parallel()</code>
            </a>
             methods. I had never actually used the
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/run-sequence">
              plugin that allowed me to do that in gulp3
            </a> so this is a welcome feature that I wasn't yet aware of.

            I also got started with
            <a target="_blank" href="http://requirejs.org/">
              require.js
            </a>
            , which also seems quite useful as move forward with building bigger
            apps. Though
            <a target="_blank" href="https://babeljs.io/">
              Babel
            </a> provides similar features that
            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html">
            are part of ES6,
            </a> so perhaps it is more worth my time to learn that. Eventually.
            </p>
            <p class="--bump-text-size">
            What is currently on my agenda is getting a decent grasp of Backbone
            and then creating a project using it. I'd like to get a remote
            server up and running as well and will hopefully use that as the
            Backend for this next project. But while this is an excellent
            learning opportunity, without a clear goal in terms of what I want
            to make I won't get far. Will figure that one out too.

          <h4>Foundations</h4>
          <p>Written on <i>Tue Mar 15 2016</i></p>
          <p class="--bump-text-size">
            I am currently in the midst of reading
            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742">
              JavaScript: The Good Parts by Douglas Crockford.
            </a>
            Pretty standard for anyone interested in JS to read this, I think,
            and I can see why. While most of the stuff up to this point has been
            on my radar, things like cascading to make chain calls and
            memoization to store computationally heavy results are things that
            I haven't implemented myself just yet. Being aware of such powerful
            tools (especially given how simple they are) is important. I
            remember writing a naive implementation of the fibonacci number
            sequence back when I first started learning programming using Python
            (not that long ago, haha) and how it was completely useless to even
            try to go for triple digit numbers because of the sheer number of
            recursive calls that occured. Using memoization the result for the
            fibonacci number at the 1460th index of the sequence gets returned
            practically instantly. While I know this is some basic stuff to
            decently advanced people, I am impressed and look forward to using
            this when the need arises. I look forward to the rest of this book!

          <h4>Making a Contribution (except not yet.)</h4>
          <p>Written on <i>Sat Mar 12 2016</i>.</p>
          <p class="--bump-text-size">
            I am currently in the process of completing the final set of
            (optional) requirements for the Frontend Nanodegree with Udacity.
            Part of this means creating a somewhat solid web presence through
            Github. What does this mean? I think it means contributing to open
            source projects that I care about.
          </p>
          <p class="--bump-text-size">
            The issue is that I have until March 18th to complete a certain set
            of projects that I have been putting aside as secondary to making
            this contribution. I spent two days getting geared up to make some
            contributions by first reading
            <a target="_blank" href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository">
              Chapter 2
            </a> and
            <a target="_blank" href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell">
              Chapter 3
            </a> of the Pro Git book by Scott Chacon, and then reading the
            <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/substack/stream-handbook">
              stream-handbook
            </a> when I thought that contributing to a tool I use a lot, gulp,
            would be the way to go. And it likely still is, but I am also getting
            the sense that to make a proper first contributution, especially when
            I am just learning Node for the first time, might not be a two day
            thing. I thought to do the classic cheat pull request by changing
            some documentation and updating the examples in the
            <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/dlmanning/gulp-sass">
              gulp-sass
            </a> repo, but then I realized that the examples were fine, and
            I was just unwittingly using the
            <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-ruby-sass">
              gulp-ruby-sass
            </a> plugin. Oh boy!
          </p>
          <p class="--bump-text-size">
            I think helping out with one of the gulp plugins is what I will do,
            and perhaps starting with some documentation as well, but its also
            gotten to the point where I have to move on for now and get the
            other stuff done - something resume-shaped, and a linked-in page
            that is not disabled being the first two on that list. I am excited
            to come back and get some contributing done but perhaps when I can
            take a bit more time to get the sense of the inner workings of a
            repository and not just for the sake of sending a pull request as
            quickly as possible - that's not the way to go. Soon.

                Harry Roberts.

              </h5>
              <p>Read on <i>Wed Mar 9 2016</i>.</p>
              <p class="--bump-text-size">As a new user of SCSS I hadn't thought
                enough about how mixins and extends can negatively affect filesize
                by creating duplicate styles. What seems dry can be just the opposite
                when the mixins I wrote once in SCSS then appear over and over again
                in my CSS... perhaps not ideal? Harry Roberts does point out
                <a target="_blank" href="http://csswizardry.com/2014/11/when-to-use-extend-when-to-use-a-mixin/#when-to-use-a-mixin">
                  here
                </a> how what we should be after is a "single source of truth"
                rather than avoiding repetition in the compiled css. I haven't
                formed a complete opinion here myself.
                <a target="_blank" href="http://thesassway.com/editorial/sass-doesnt-create-bad-code-bad-coders-do#mixins-will-bloat-your-css-by-repeating-code">
                  This is covered here.
                </a></p>
                <p class="--bump-text-size">Tight coupling is also worth being aware
                  of - any styles that are used as extensions have to be documented
                  as such, lest edits of one class lead to unintended changes in the
                styles that the edited class extends into.</p>
                <p class="--bump-text-size">
                  <a target="_blank" href="http://csswizardry.com/2014/01/extending-silent-classes-in-sass/">
                    This article
                  </a> by Harry Roberts goes even further in pointing
                  out issues with <code>@extend</code>. Namely, that it extends
                  all instances of the class, including those that are part of more
                  specific selectors with other classes/tags/pseudo classes. This
                  is perhaps undesirable, and maybe worth avoiding entirely. The
                proposed solution involves <b>silent classes</b>, written like so</p>
                              <pre><code>.foo,
                  %foo {
                    color: #acce55;
                  }
                  .bar .foo {
                    background-color: #0dba11;
                  }
                  .baz {
                    @extend %foo;
                }                </code></pre>
                <p class="--bump-text-size">
                  As this will allow us to avoid extending the
                  <code>background-color</code> into <code>baz</code>, instead
                  extending only the <code>color</code> property.
                </p>
                <p class="--bump-text-size">
                  And, of course, Harry continues in this line of unpacking the
                  perils of <code>`@extend`</code> in
                  <a target="_blank" href="http://csswizardry.com/2016/02/mixins-better-for-performance/">
                    a much more recent article.
                  </a> Where he points out that after
                  gzipping, the repetition from mixins actually resolves to a
                  smaller, more efficient filesize than even <code>@extend</code>s that result
                  in smaller .css files sizes due to comma separated classes. Somewhere
                  along the way I also picked up the possibility of setting default
                  values for mixins like this: <code>@mixin my-mixin($var: default) {}
                  </code> which could be handy!

                    The Sass Style Guide by Chris Coyier
                  </a> is also a useful resource. Something that I already got out
                  of it is the advantage of using mixins for media queries. This
                  makes nesting media queries in the classes that get affected by
                  them much neater and it becomes an actually desirable strategy.
                  This works because we keep account of the breakpoints in a
                  centralized place and if we want to move these around we can do
                  so without having to hunt down each media query nested in the
                  classes. It also mentions the use of the funny but quite likely
                  very useful

                  to help prioritize cleaning up hacky code. The first step
                  for me will of course be recognizing what is hacky and what is
                  solid. `!important` and IDs some to mind... but apart from that?

                    Ethan Muller has an article called Naming CSS Stuff Is Really Hard
                  </a>
                  where he recommends using functional class names (like
                  "positive-button") that are less likely to change instead of
                  getting too specific. This isn't always possible due to
                  incidental styles. He argues against using content based classes
                  (like "submit-button") for larger sites and and espouses
                  presentational styles like ("green-button") as these
                  communicate more clearly and allow for more reusability.

                    Felicity Evans in A Vision for Our Sass
                  </a> mentions the need to name variables based on their function
                  rather than the way they look. This makes sense when thinking
                  about changing the style of a page so that you can avoid having
                  to rename all the classes each time you change a theme color.
                  There is no easy answer between this and the points Ethan Muller
                  made, but navigating through this seems like a reasonable
                  challenge to undertake in my css experience. Of course she goes
                  on an makes a convincing case against presentational class names
                  as well, urging to use these as <code>@extend</code>s instead,
                  and as such keeping them out of the HTML.

                  The first takeaway from
                  <a target="_blank" href="http://alistapart.com/column/what-will-save-us-from-the-dark-side-of-pre-processors">
                    Lyza Danger Gardner in What Will Save Us from the Dark Side of
                  CSS Pre-Processors?</a> is to actually look at the outputed CSS
                  when using SCSS... this has been mentioned by many of the articles
                  linked before as well. The reason I chose this article in the
                  first place (it was really my starting point but it ended up
                  branching to all the other stuff I read today/yesterday) was to
                  get a sense of PostCSS... missed the mark on that, but I learned
                  a lot about preprocessors! PostCSS will come soon.

                <p>Read on <i>Sun Mar 6 2016</i>.</p>
                <p class="--bump-text-size">This and the follow up article talk about an alternative to the
                  UX we're used to. Basically an AI driven experience where a user types
                  (or says, though Matty seems to be less into that) commands and the program
                  parses them intelligently. This requires some rethinking in the kind
                  of discoverability alloted to users. Pretty interesting. While the
                  case for why this is better wasn't expressly communicated, I still
                  think the possibilities and accessibility of such a UI is great.
