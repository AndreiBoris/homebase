Borges Medeiros</a> (from 2011!). Though realistically I also read a bunch of stuff by <a href="http://csswizardry.com/about/">Harry Roberts.</a> ... among other articles on SCSS.</h5><p>Read on <i>Wed Mar 9 2016</i>.</p><p class="--bump-text-size">As a new user of SCSS I hadn't thought enough about how mixins and extends can negatively affect filesize by creating duplicate styles. What seems dry can be just the opposite when the mixins I wrote once in SCSS then appear over and over again in my CSS... perhaps not ideal? Harry Roberts does point out <a href="http://csswizardry.com/2014/11/when-to-use-extend-when-to-use-a-mixin/#when-to-use-a-mixin">here</a> how what we should be after is a "single source of truth" rather than avoiding repetition in the compiled css. I haven't formed a complete opinion here myself. <a href="http://thesassway.com/editorial/sass-doesnt-create-bad-code-bad-coders-do#mixins-will-bloat-your-css-by-repeating-code">This is covered here.</a></p><p class="--bump-text-size">Tight coupling is also worth being aware of - any styles that are used as extensions have to be documented as such, lest edits in one style lead to unintended changes in the styles that the edited one feeds into.</p><p class="--bump-text-size"><a href="http://csswizardry.com/2014/01/extending-silent-classes-in-sass/">This article</a> by Harry Roberts goes even further in pointing out the perils of <code>@extend</code>, namely, that it extends all instances of the class, which is perhaps undesirable, and maybe worth avoiding entirely. The proposed solution involves <b>silent classes</b>, written like so</p><pre><code>.foo,
%foo {
  color: #acce55;
}

.bar .foo {
  background-color: #0dba11;
}

.baz {
  @extend %foo;
}                </code></pre><p class="--bump-text-size">As this will allow us to avoid extending the <code>background-color</code> into <code>baz</code>, instead extending only the <code>color</code> property.</p><p class="--bump-text-size">And, of course, Harry continues in this line of unpacking the perils of <code>`@extend`</code> in <a href="http://csswizardry.com/2016/02/mixins-better-for-performance/">a much more recent article.</a> Where he points out that after gzipping, the repetition from mixins actually resolves to a smaller, more efficient filesize than even <code>@extend</code>s that result in smaller .css files sizes due to comma separated classes. Somewhere along the way I also picked up the possibility of setting default values for mixins like this: <code>@mixin my-mixin($var: default) {}</code> which could be handy!</p><p class="--bump-text-size"><a href="https://css-tricks.com/sass-style-guide/">The Sass Style Guide by Chris Coyier</a> is also a useful resource. Something that I already got out of it is the advantage of using mixins for media queries. This makes nesting media queries in the classes that get affected by them much neater and it becomes an actually desirable strategy. This works because we keep account of the breakpoints in a centralized place and if we want to move these around we can do so without having to hunt down each media query nested in the classes. It also mentions the use of the funny but quite likely very useful <a href="http://csswizardry.com/2013/04/shame-css/">shame.css file</a> to help with, eventually, cleaning up hacky code. The first step for me will of course be recognizing what is hacky and what is solid. `!important` and IDs some to mind... but apart from that?</p><p class="--bump-text-size"><a href="http://seesparkbox.com/foundry/naming_css_stuff_is_really_hard">Ethan Muller has an article called Naming CSS Stuff Is Really Hard</a> where he recommends using functional class names (like "positive-button") that are less likely to change instead of getting too specific. This isn't always possible due to incidental styles. He argues against using content based classes (like "submit-button") for larger sites and and espouses presentational styles like ("green-button") as these communicate more clearly and allow for more reusability.</p><p class="--bump-text-size">Felicity Evans in <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/a-vision-for-our-sass">A Vision for Our Sass</a> mentions the need to name variables based on their function rather than the way they look. This makes sense when thinking about changing the style of a page so that you can avoid having to rename all the classes each time you change a theme color. There is no easy answer between this and the points Ethan Muller made, but navigating through this seems like a reasonable challenge to undertake in my css experience. Of course she goes on an makes a convincing case against presentational class names as well, urging to use these as <code>@extend</code>s instead, and as such keeping them out of the HTML.</p><p class="--bump-text-size">The first takeaway from <a href="http://alistapart.com/column/what-will-save-us-from-the-dark-side-of-pre-processors">Lyza Danger Gardner in What Will Save Us from the Dark Side of CSS Pre-Processors?</a> is to actually look at the outputed CSS when using SCSS... this has been mentioned by many of the articles linked before as well. The reason I chose this article in the first place (it was really my starting point but it ended up branching to all the other stuff I read today/yesterday) was to get a sense of PostCSS... missed the mark on that, but I learned a lot about preprocessors! PostCSS will come soon.</p></li><li><h5><a href="http://alistapart.com/article/all-talk-and-no-buttons-the-conversational-ui" target="_blank">All Talk and No Buttons: The Conversational UI by Matty Mariansky</a></h5><p>Read on <i>Sun Mar 6 2016</i>.</p><p class="--bump-text-size">This and the follow up article talk about an alternative to the UX we're used to. Basically an AI driven experience where a user types (or says, though Matty seems to be less into that) commands and the program parses them intelligently. This requires some rethinking in the kind of discoverability alloted to users. Pretty interesting. While the case for why this is better wasn't expressly communicated, I still think the possibilities and accessibility of such a UI is great. Recommended!</p></li></ul></article></section><div class="row graphic graphic--has-spacing--medium u-full-width"><div class="graphic__straight-lines--yellow"></div></div><footer><div class="row --has-spacing--top"><h2 id="contact" class="--no-spacing--bottom">Reach Me</h2></div><div class="row"><div class="--text u-full-width footer"><div class="footer__row"><ul class="--no-list-style"><li><span class="footer__row__list__label">Github</span> <a href="https://github.com/AndreiCommunication" class="footer__row__list__link">AndreiCommunication</a></li><li><span class="footer__row__list__label">Twitter</span> <a href="https://twitter.com/BreathMachine" class="footer__row__list__link">@BreathMachine</a></li><li><span class="footer__row__list__label">Email</span> <a href="mailto:Andrei.Borissenko@gmail.com" class="footer__row__list__link">Andrei.Borissenko@gmail.com</a></li><li><span class="footer__row__list__label">LinkedIn</span> <a href="#" class="footer__row__list__link">Andrei Borissenko</a></li></ul></div><div class="row footer__row--bottom">Learning Stuff, Helping Out</div></div></div></footer></div><script type="text/javascript" src="dist/perm/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/underscore.js/1.8.3/underscore-min.js"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/backbone.js/1.2.1/backbone-min.js"></script><script src="dist/scripts/main.min.js"></script></body></html>
